                    <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p>Bistro 76 first opened in 1970, (although it was in our home kitchen), where our mother started cooking and selling her famous lasagna to families in town having events. It didn't take long to grow out of that setup, and the Bistro 76 became a small sit-down restaurant where the entire Smith clan grew up.</p>
                    <p>Our family-style meals are made for sharing, with fresh, local ingredients. We've never cut corners on ingredients, service, or comfort. Whether you stop by on a weeknight to save yourself from a frozen dinner, or you choose us to cater your wedding or other event, we are sure that you'll leave with a smile and a full stomach.</p>
